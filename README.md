extended magazines for SPTarkov

there are just some clone from origin template with **5x** ammo count and no side effects

to keep it simple, each weapon has its own dedicated extended magazine, although they should be interchangeable

# why use this Mod instead of modifying the server parameters
change exist magazines will cause bot have a lot of ammo, too easy to accumulate wealth if you loot them

it is also recommended to modify the bot's health value to 4 times but exclude head part
